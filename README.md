# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using a linear regression model. The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains various features of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The training dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing different aspects of the houses, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, etc. The target variable is the sale price of the houses. The test dataset contains the same features except for the target variable.

You can download the dataset from the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).
